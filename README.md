# Data-warehousing-using-Sales-HR-Data
I used data of an HR team and Sales team to create a data warehouse

I used 4 different zones for warehousing.

-> Within rawzone was the Extracted data from the source.

-> Normalized the data in Atomic zone and Denormalized it according to the requirement in Dimensional Zone.

-> Since reporting zone was not such a concern it was left out.

Metadata file provides with all the required knowledge as it contains the following columns.
Source	
-> Table	COLUMN	
-> Column_DESC	
-> Column_Format	
-> COL_DEPENDENCY	
-> Source query
